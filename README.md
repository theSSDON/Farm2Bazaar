## Problem
Farmers in India face many problems, the biggest of which is the decentalised and unorganised agricultural sector. Varying weather and climactic conditions, fluctuating crop prices, and limited MSP quota is a big problem for farmers, especially small and medium land owners, as well as landless farmers, in India. There's a big problem of supply chains in India, with the farmer finding it quite difficult to sell produce within their own states, let alone outside.

Traders, meanwhile, have their own share of problems owing to the mandi system and midllemen charging exorbant prices, hoarding of crops during certain times of the year and a varying customer base, not happy with the quality of the produce

Farm2Bazaar aims at easing the lives of both the farmers and the traders and connect both of them, without the interference of agents or the mandis.
